1. Raising fame levels
With the given project description fame levels cannot go up, they can only either stay the same or decrease which makes it
impossible to increase number of people in communities.
Our idea is to add a counter that stores current numeric value of the user's fame level in each area:
the number lies in the interval [numeric value of current fame level, numeric value of the next fame level).
If the new post with this content is published for the first time ever on this platform, the numeric value of the current
is added to the counter. If the new numeric value in the counter is equal to or greater than the next level's numeric value,
change the level to the next one (unless the maximal level is already reached).
When the level of the person is decreased, the counter is set exactly to the numeric value of the new level.
Uniqueness of the posts that raise the fame level ensures that people don't just copy their single successful post many times
to get their fame level to the maximum and don't copy successful posts of other people with the same goal.
